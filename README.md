# Ryan Helgeson - iOS Developer

Looking to build upon my career in iOS Development. Started developing in iOS in early 2020, after working internships as a software engineer and biomechanics. Passionate worker with an enthusiasm to continue learning all facets of iOS development.

Currently researching SwiftUI and the power it brings to quick UI development. Working part-time as an iOS Engineer at Modus Engagement Inc. supporting the full-time engineer with code reviews and mentoring.

Most recent full-time work is June 29th, 2023 at Xeal as an iOS Engineer. Let go as a result of budget cuts due to a smaller than expected EV charging market. Willing to provide references of performance while at Xeal upon request.

Love sports, played baseball at Augustana University for 5 years where we one the D2 National Championship in 2018. Play in multiple fantasy leagues across NFL and MLB, and am always willing to join more.
