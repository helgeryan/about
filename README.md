# Ryan Helgeson - iOS Developer

I am looking to build upon my career in iOS Development. Started developing in iOS in early 2020, after working internships as a software engineer and biomechanics. I am a fast starter and am adaptible to many different environements. 

Currently, I am researching SwiftUI and the power it brings to quick UI development. I stay up to date with iOS and the changes Apple makes every year at their companies WWDC. Always looking for the opportunities that it may provide to developers as a whole, and specifically to the role I am in.

Most recent full-time work is 2025 at Switcher Studio as an iOS Engineer.

I am a strong interest in sports, as I played baseball at Augustana University for 5 years where we one the D2 National Championship in 2018. As a hobby I play in multiple fantasy leagues across NFL and MLB, and am always willing to join more!

He is a proactive and fast learner who embraces new challenges with enthusiasm and effectiveness. Ryan consistently demonstrates strong communication skillsâ€”clearly articulating his ideas and offering mentorship to those around him.

He excels at identifying and resolving complex production issues, catching subtle problems during code reviews, and spotting critical gaps during refinement sessions.
